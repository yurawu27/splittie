# Splittie

## Overview

Splittie is an application that takes the hassle out of splitting bills with friends, family, or colleagues. Whether you’re at a restaurant that doesn’t allow individual payments or splitting costs for a group activity, Splittie ensures everyone pays their fair share without the awkwardness or complexity of manual calculations. Users can register and login, and then start creating bill entries. With a few simple entries, the person handling the bill can create a new bill entry by entering the total amount, taxes, and/or tips, then add each participant and their items. Splittie calculates exactly what each person owes, down to the cent, leaving no room for mistakes or misunderstandings.

In addition to simplifying bill creation, Splittie allows users to track payments, view who has reimburse their portion, and send reminders to those who haven’t yet paid.
